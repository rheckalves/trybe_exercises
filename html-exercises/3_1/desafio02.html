	Nobody’s born smart. We all<strong> start at 0.</strong> Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
	Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at<strong><em> anything</em></strong> at first.<br>
	There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
	And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs <strong>just like the rest of us.</strong><br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
	Slowly. <em>Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
	One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the <strong>next.</strong><br>
	Each <em><strong>wrong answer</strong></em> making your brain a little bit<strong> stronger.</strong><br>
	Failing is <em>just another word</em> for <strong>growing.</strong> And you keep going.<br>
	This. is. <em>learning.</em><br>
	It’s not that you <strong>don’t get it.</strong> <br>
	You just don’t get it, <strong>yet.</strong>
	Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the<em><strong> whole universe</strong></em><br>
	are built on <strong>basic ideas</strong> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
